# StringConcatenation
 This C++ console application prompts the user to enter two separate strings three times. After each input pair, it concatenates the two strings together and displays the resulting concatenated string on the screen. This process repeats for a total of three iterations, allowing the user to input different string combinations and observe the concatenated output each time.
